Open Ephys for 64-bit Windows
=============================

This repository will eventually contain 64-bit Windows binary files for the Open Ephys GUI. If you'd
like to help us build them, please [get in touch.](http://open-ephys.org/contact)

In the meantime, the 32-bit Windows application will run just fine.

For the source code, see http://github.com/open-ephys/GUI
